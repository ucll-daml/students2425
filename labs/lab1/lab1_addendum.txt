Creating a Virtual Environment:
    command: python -m venv .venv (this will create a venv named .venv, you can change the last word to whatever name you want to give your virtual environment)
    for mac users: python3 - m venv .venv

    alternative approach: create a virtual environment using the VS Code buttons:
        click on "select kernel" or the python environment at the top right corner of your notebook
        click "select another kernel" > "python environments" > "create python environment" > venv

    Note: if you can't select a kernel when running your Jupyter notebook, you might need to install extensions first
